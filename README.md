School District Analysis

In this new challenge in which we find ourselves when using Pandas, I managed to develop a new skill in which, through practice and constant use, I will be able to dominate 100%, some of the observations or notes that I can add about the challenge are the following:

•	In this challenge it was discovered how fast you can process large amounts of information.

•	We were able to identify the existing schools within the district so that Maria can plan different strategies.

•	The students with the highest percentage of reading and math skills were identified, as well as the type of entity they belonged to, Public or Charter.

•	The average in the different abilities in which the schools are found was identified.

Thanks to these statistical tendencies that we managed to generate, Maria is able to generate better strategies for the schools in the district and will be able to have a better vision of the performance of each one of the schools.
